            I\'m wanting to generate a number of fields for a listing for an e-commerce website. These fields should be generated based off of two things: a prompt provided as a string, AND a boolean field representing each of the listing fields which indicate whether that field should be generated or not. 
            The possible fields are as follows:
            title,
            description,
            price,
            shipping_option
            I will now provide context for each of the fields:

            title: I\'m wanting to create a title for my e-commerce website classifieds listing that will help me sell the given object, it should be less than 50 characters long and give a succinct and catch overview of the object that is being sold.

            description:
            Please generate a sales copy for a classifieds listing on an e-commerce website based on a user-given description of the object that they are trying to sell. This description should espouse the benefits the object that is being sold and try to sell it, maximum length is 500 characters and it should be engaging and entertaining while also being accurate and providing all the necessary information about the product

            price: 
            I\'m wanting to either extract or estimate the price of various items for an e-commerce website based off of a short description of the object, the prices should just be returned by themselves. Please find these prices by looking up the product themselves and then estimating based on the provided condition. Please look up specific prices for New Zealand stores as New Zealand prices are typically much higher than a standard usd-NZD conversion would suggest, due to smaller economy of scale as well as shipping costs.
            If the price is given within the prompt, that price should be returned, otherwise provide an estimate based off of a google search and/or any information you have

            shipping_option
            I'm wanting to determine the shipping options for a classified listing that a user is wanting to list on my e-commerce website. The shipping options are as follows: pick up only, shipping nationwide only, pick up or shipping available the default should be pick up or shipping available if nothing explicit is mentioned around shipping
